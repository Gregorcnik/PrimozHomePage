                <summary>Census of rotary maps</summary>
                <p>Based on the census of (2,*)-groups (see below), a census of all rotary maps was constructed. Recall that a rotary map is either chiral (in which case its
                  group of automorphisms acts regularly on the oriented edges of the graph but contains no orientation reversing automorphism), or regular (in which case the
                  automorphism group acts regularly on the flags of the map), the latter either orientable or non-orientable. The census is complete up to 1500 edges in the
                  case of non-orientable maps, and up to 3000 edges for orientable maps (both chiral and regular). The previously known
                  <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/">census of Marston Conder</a> contained the maps up to 1000 edges.
                  A census of the underlying skeleton graphs of these maps was also computed. For more information and instruction how to
                  use the census, please read the <a href="RotaryMaps/Census-RotaryMaps-README.txt">README file</a>. The following files are available for
                  download (note that some of these files are rather large – largest is 34MB long):

                <summary>Census of cubic vertex-transitive graphs</summary>
                <p>A census (compiled by Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself) of cubic vertex-transitive graphs on at most 1280 vertices is available at

                <summary>Census of (2,*)-groups</summary>
                <p>A (2,*)-generated group is a group that can be generated by an involution and one extra element. A magma file containing all (2,*)-groups of order at most 6000
                  is available for download <a href="TwoStarGroups/TwoStarGroups.mgm">here</a>. This mgm file requires also this <a href="TwoStarGroups/TwoStarGroups6k.txt.zip">txt file</a>
                  (zipped). Moreover, the mgm file contains a function that will generate all the corresponding generating pairs of the (2,*)-groups (modulo the action of the automorphism
                  group of the group). This function will need the following, rather lengthy <a href="TwoStarGroups/TwoStarPairs6k.txt.zip">file</a> (about 585Mb zipped).
                  To read more about this, click <a href="TwoStarGroups/TwoStarGroups-README.txt">here</a>. This work makes part of a larger project (by Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret
                  and myself) of constructing complete lists of 4-valent half-arc-transitive graphs and cubic vertex-transitive graphs (see below).</p>

                <summary>Census of 2-valent arc-transitive digraphs</summary>
                <p>Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself have compiled a complete list of all connected arc-transitive digraphs on at most 1.000 vertices.
                  As a byproduct, we've computed all connected 4-valent graphs with at most 1.000 vertices that admit a half-arc-transitive action of a group of automorphisms.
                  In particular, all tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs are there. The graphs are available in magma format (note that the graphs might fail to load
                  into some older versions of magma, or magma for Windows). Click <a href="ATDcensus-OnLine/Census-ATD-1k-README.txt">here</a> to get more information
                  about the organisation of the census. To download a complete zipped file with the lists of graphs and accompanying data, plese click
                  <a href="ATDcensus-OnLine/ATDcensus-OnLine.zip">here</a> (note that this file has more than 100Mb). The csv files containing the list of
                  <a href="ATDcensus-OnLine/Census-ATD-1k-data.csv">2-valent arc-transitive digraphs</a>, the list of

                  graph-theoretical invariants is also available. More about this can be found in the paper: <i>P. Potočnik, P. Spiga, G. Verret,

                <summary>Census of arc-transitive tetravalent graphs</summary>
                <p>Based on some theoretical work of Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself, we were able to construct a complete list of all
                  tetravalent arc-transitive graphs on at most 640 vertices. The magma code which generates the sequence of these graphs can be
                  found <a href="work_datoteke/Census4val-640.mgm">here</a>. If you use this list for research purposes, please cite the following papers:

                <summary>Census of edge-transitive tetravalent graphs</summary>
                <p>I am currently involved in an ambitious project, suggested by <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~swilson">Steve Wilson NE DELUJE</a>
                  of <a href="http://nau.edu/">Northern Arizona University</a>, whose aim is to compile a complete list (census) of all edge-transitive
                  tetravalent graphs on at most 512 vertices. The current (uncomplete) version of the census can be found
                  <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~swilson/C4FullSite/index.html">here</a>. There are several segments, though, in which the current version
                  is complete. For example, it contains all 2-arc-transitive graphs up to that order, as well as all arc-transitive and half-arc-transitive
                  graphs (due to the joint work with G. Verret and P. Spiga mentioned above). The census is, however, incomplete for the case of semisymmetric
                  graphs. Some of the semisymmetric graphs from the table are available in magma code <a href="TetraSS2016/TetraSS2016.zip">here</a>
                  (after unzipping the downloaded file, copy the *.mgm and *.txt file to the magma work directory and load the *.mgm file into magma –
                  a double sequence TetraSS will be created with TetraSS[n,k] being the k-th graph on n vertices). For more details on this census,

                <summary>Census of pentavalent arc-transitive graphs</summary>
                <p>I have started constructing some examples of pentavalent arc-transitive graphs. The current
                  <a href="work_datoteke/AT5-Census.mag">list</a> (in magma code) contains all those pentavalent
                  arc-transitive graphs on up to 500 vertices which admit an arc-transitive group G with the vertex stabiliser G_v acting
                  faithfully on the neighbourhood of v and being solvable (i.e. G_v is one of C_5, D_5, or Aff(1,5)). Beware, this is work
                  in progress—codenames of the graphs might change in the future.</p>

                <summary>Some other edge-transitive graphs</summary>
                <p>Here's a <a href="work_datoteke/CensusLAT34.mgm">magma code</a> generating the bipartite biregular graphs of valence {3,4}
                  that are locally G-arc-transitive for some group of automorphisms G with the edge stabiliser G_uv of an edge uv acting
                  faithfully on the union of the neighbourhoods of u and v. This list contains graphs up to 1050 and is complete up to 350 vertices,
                  but might miss some graphs in the range of 350 and 1050 vertices. More about the list can be found in the paper: <i>P. Potočnik,
